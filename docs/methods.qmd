## Overview

We developed an individual-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) transmission model to assess the impact of indoor air quality interventions on airborne pathogen transmission.
The model simulates disease spread across a synthetic population distributed among households, schools, workplaces, leisure venues, and community settings.

## Population structure and data sources

We simulated a population of individuals stratified into three age groups: children, adults, and elderly.
Household sizes and age composition were sampled from a 2010 San Francisco synthetic population produced by RTI International.
School enrollment sizes were sampled from U.S. National Center for Education Statistics 2019–2020 data.
Workplace sizes were sampled from a truncated offset power law distribution [@ferguson2005strategies].
Leisure venue capacities were sampled from a negative binomial distribution, and weekly visit frequencies were sampled from a Poisson distribution.

## Transmission dynamics

The force of infection (FOI) experienced by an individual $i$ at time $t$ was decomposed across locations $j$ and settings $s$ as
$$
\lambda_i(t) = \sum_{j, s} \lambda_{i, j, s}(t).
$$
We modelled the location- and setting- specific FOI as
$$
\lambda_{i, j, s}(t) = \frac{\beta_{j, s} I_{j, s}(t)}{N_{j, s}},
$$
where $I_{j, s}(t)$ is the number of infectious individuals in location $j$ of setting $s$, $N_{j, s}$ is the total occupancy, and $\beta_{j, s} = \gamma_{j, s} \beta_s$ is a transmissibility parameter.
The term $\beta_s$ represents a setting-average transmissibility, while $\gamma_{j, s} \sim \text{Lognormal}(0, \sigma_s)$ captures within-setting heterogeneity in transmission risk arising from variation in ventilation rates and occupancy density.

We set between-setting transmission rate ratios to
$$
\beta_{\text{household}}:\beta_{\text{school}}:\beta_{\text{workplace}}:\beta_{\text{leisure}}:\beta_{\text{community}} = 3:3:3:3:1
$$
based on empirical data on transmission location.
The sum of $\beta_s$ values were scaled to achieve target effective reproduction numbers for specific pathogen archetypes.

## Within-setting heterogeneity

To parameterize within-setting variation $\sigma_s$, we modeled airborne pathogen concentration $C(t)$ using an ordinary differential equation
$$
\nu \frac{\text{d}C(t)}{\text{d}t} =  - QC(t) - k_D \nu C(t) + I \pi,
$$
where $\nu$ is room volume, $Q$ is air flow rate, $k_D = 0.64 \text{h}^{-1}$ is a pathogen decay constant, and $\pi = 27$ virions per person per hour is the emission rate.
We assumed room volume $\nu = N D_s H$ where $H = 2.5 \text{m}$ and $D_s$ represents setting-specific occupancy density (persons per $100 \text{m}^2$): $D_{\text{household}} = 5$, $D_{\text{school}} = 30$, $D_{\text{workplace}} = 10$, $D_{\text{leisure}} = 50$.

The Wells-Riley equation gives individual infection probability after time $t$ in concentration $C$ as
$$
P(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-rBCt\right),
$$
with breathing rate $B = 0.45 \text{m}^3 \text{h}^{-1}$ and infection probability per virion $r = 1.37 \times 10^{-2}$.
We calculated upper and lower bounds of infection probability using setting-specific ranges of air changes per hour, and assuming individuals spend 12 hours in households, 8 hours in schools/workplaces, 2.5 hours at leisure venues, and 1.5 hours in community settings.
A lognormal distribution was fitted to the upper and lower infection probabilities bounds to determine $\sigma_s$.

## Pathogen archetypes

We simulated two pathogen archetypes approximating influenza ($R_0 \approx 1.5$) and SARS-CoV-2 ($R_0 \approx 2.5$).
Setting-specific transmissibility parameters were calibrated using the `finalsize` R package to reproduce epidemic final sizes corresponding to each $R_0$.
Latent and infectious periods were set to approximate each pathogen's natural history.

## Air quality interventions

Air quality interventions (AQIs) were assumed to reduce the location-specific FOI multiplicatively by efficacy $E_{j, s}$ according to
$$
\lambda^{\text{AQI}}_{i, j, s}(t) = (1 - E_{j, s}) \times \lambda_{i, j, s}(t).
$$
We evaluated intervention strategies varying by efficacy, coverage level, and allocation strategy (random vs. targeted to highest-risk locations within each setting type).

## Simulation study

We simulated both endemic and epidemic scenarios for each pathogen archetype under multiple AQI strategies: no AQI (baseline), random allocation at varying coverage levels, and targeted allocation to highest-risk locations within each setting.
Each scenario was replicated `r number_of_simulations` times.

For endemic scenarios, we computed annualized disease incidence and average infection prevalence.
For epidemic scenarios, we computed epidemic final size and peak infection incidence.

All simulations were implemented using the open-source `helios` R package built on the `individual` framework, with parallel computing performed using the `hipercow` package on Imperial College London's high-performance computing cluster.

## Data sources

Household sizes and age composition were sampled with replacement from a 2010 San Francisco synthetic population produced by RTI International.
School enrollment sizes were derived from U.S. National Center for Education Statistics 2019–2020 data.
Workplace sizes were sampled from a truncated offset power law distribution based on @ferguson2005strategies.

## Modelling framework

We built an individual-based SEIR model.
Individuals belong to fixed households and one of three age groups (children, adults, and elderly).

The force of infection experienced by an individual $i$ at time $t$ can be decomposed as a sum of location $j$ and setting $s$ specific contributions $\lambda_i(t) = \sum_{j, s} \lambda_{i, j, s}(t)$.
We modelled
$$
\lambda_{i, j, s}(t) = \frac{\beta_{j, s} I_{j, s}(t)}{N_{j, s}},
$$
where $\beta_{j, s} = \gamma_{j, s} \beta_s$ is a transmisibility parameter, $I_{j, s}(t)$ is the number of infectious individuals, and $N_{j, s}$ is the total number of individuals.
The parameter $\beta_s$ is the setting-average transmissibility and $\gamma_{j, s}$ captures within-setting heterogeneity arising from ventilation and occupancy.

Between settings we fixed transmission rate $\beta_s$ ratios to 3:3:3:3:1.
Then we scaled their sum to match target effective reproduction numbers for given pathogen archetypes.
The pathogen archetypes approximate influenza and SARS-CoV-2 using values calibrated with the `finalsize` R package to reproduce the required epidemic final sizes.

Air quality interventions (AQIs) were assumed to reduce location-specific force of infection multiplicatively.
For efficacy $E_{j, s}$ then $\lambda^{\text{AQI}}_{i, j, s}(t) = (1 - E_{j, s}) \times \lambda_{i, j, s}(t)$.

## Wells-Riley and within-room dynamics

We combined an ODE for airborne concentration with the Wells–Riley formula.

## Simulation study

We simulated endemic and epidemic scenarios for each pathogen archetype under multiple AQI strategies: no AQI, random allocation at varying coverage, and targeted allocation to highest-risk locations within each setting.
For each scenario we ran `r number_of_simulations` simulations.
Under endemic scenarios we computed disease burden as annualised disease incidence and average infection prevalence, and under epidemic scenarios we computed the epidemic final size and peak infection incidence.
